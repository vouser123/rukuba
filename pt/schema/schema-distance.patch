 ## pattern
 - side          # q sets of z reps per side
 - both          # q sets of z reps done with both sides simultaneously
-- side-measure  # q sets of z measured units per side

 ## pattern_modifiers
 - duration_seconds  # replaces reps with seconds (e.g., 3 x 30s)
 - hold_seconds      # adds isometric hold time per rep (e.g., 3 x 10 reps, 5s hold)
 - AMRAP             # as many reps as possible in a defined duration
+- distance          # replaces reps with distance (e.g., 3 x 20 ft); keep actual value/unit in program layer
