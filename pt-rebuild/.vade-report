# Vercel Speed Insights Integration

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights tracking scripts across all HTML pages in the PT Tracker application.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **public/index.html** - Added Speed Insights scripts before closing body tag
2. **public/pt_editor.html** - Added Speed Insights scripts before closing body tag
3. **public/pt_view.html** - Added Speed Insights scripts before closing body tag
4. **public/rehab_coverage.html** - Added Speed Insights scripts before closing body tag
5. **public/reset-password.html** - Added Speed Insights scripts before closing body tag

## Implementation Details

Since this is a static HTML application (not a framework like Next.js or React), I followed the HTML implementation guide from the Vercel Speed Insights documentation.

Added the following scripts before the closing `</body>` tag in all HTML files:

```html
<!-- Vercel Speed Insights -->
<script>
    window.si = window.si || function () { (window.siq = window.siq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js"></script>
```

## What This Enables

- **Performance Tracking**: Once deployed to Vercel with Speed Insights enabled in the dashboard, the application will automatically track real user performance metrics
- **Script Loading**: The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be available after deployment
- **No Package Installation**: As per the HTML implementation guide, no npm package installation is required

## Next Steps (Manual)

To complete the Speed Insights setup:

1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Select the "Speed Insights" tab
   - Click "Enable"

2. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   vercel deploy
   ```

3. View metrics in the dashboard after users visit the site

## Technical Notes

- The scripts are loaded with the `defer` attribute to prevent blocking page load
- The initialization function ensures the Speed Insights queue is available immediately
- All 5 HTML pages in the application now include the tracking scripts
- The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for HTML/vanilla JavaScript applications
