# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics across all HTML pages in the PT Tracker application. The analytics script tracks page views and user interactions to provide insights into application usage.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
Added the Vercel Web Analytics script to all 5 HTML pages in the application:

1. **public/index.html** - Main PT Tracker application
2. **public/pt_editor.html** - Exercise Library Manager
3. **public/pt_view.html** - History Dashboard
4. **public/rehab_coverage.html** - Coverage Analysis page
5. **public/reset-password.html** - Password Reset page

### Script Implementation
For each HTML file, added the following code before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- Vercel Web Analytics -->
<script>
    window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

This implementation:
- Follows Vercel's recommended approach for HTML sites
- Uses the `defer` attribute for optimal page load performance
- Initializes the `window.va` function for queuing analytics calls
- Loads the analytics script from `/_vercel/insights/script.js`

### Integration with Existing Analytics
The Web Analytics script was added alongside the existing Vercel Speed Insights implementation, maintaining consistency across all pages. Both analytics tools work independently and complement each other:
- **Speed Insights**: Tracks performance metrics
- **Web Analytics**: Tracks page views and user behavior

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Enable Web Analytics in Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to the Analytics tab
   - Click "Enable" to activate Web Analytics

2. **Deploy the Application**
   - Deploy to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by pushing to the connected Git repository
   - The `/_vercel/insights/*` routes will be automatically configured after deployment

3. **View Analytics Data**
   - After deployment, visit any page in the application
   - Check the browser's Network tab for a request to `/_vercel/insights/view`
   - View aggregated data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Technical Notes

- No package installation required (HTML implementation uses CDN)
- No build process changes needed
- Zero impact on existing functionality
- Fully compatible with the project's serverless API architecture
- Works in both development and production environments

## Files Modified
- public/index.html
- public/pt_editor.html
- public/pt_view.html
- public/rehab_coverage.html
- public/reset-password.html

All changes are non-breaking and follow Vercel's best practices for Web Analytics integration in HTML applications.
